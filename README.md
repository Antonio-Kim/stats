# Stats project using composition and inheritance

The main purpose of this project is to implement simple statistical methods
to a csv file that could be loaded, analyzed and output various avenues.
Although the project's name maybe a simple statistical analysis, the main
purpose is to implement and highlight the main difference between **composition** using
interface, and **inheritance** using abstract classes. The current repo implements
composition, but under 'src/inheritance', the inheritance method is available.
